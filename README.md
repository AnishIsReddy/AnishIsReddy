#### <ins> GamePigeon Wordhunt Solver </ins>
There was an app that let me and my friends text games to each other on iMessage called GamePigeon, and one of thsoe games was called Word Hunt. The Premise of the game was that you had a 4x4 board of tiles with a random letter, and you needed to create words by connecting a tile with other adjacent tiles to form words. Longer words are worth more points, and the player who can get the most points within a minute is the winner. 

I was intrigured by this game and decided to write a program to help me beat my friends since i wasn't very good at it. I used Python for the graphics library and for creating subprocesses to run precompiled C++ code. That C++ code would run a BFS at a specified tile to find all the possible words that could start at that given tile. I would then display that information to the user in a UI that allowed them to easily make the words in their own gameboard.
